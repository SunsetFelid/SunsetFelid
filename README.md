- 👋 Hi, I’m @SunsetFelid
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code, making illustrations with Clip Studio Paint, and playing video games
- 🌱 I’m currently learning CSS, HTML, and Javascript, and I want to learn Python later. I'm also learning GML from GameMaker.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on game projects! I cannot work in a 3d space so I can't make 3D models on my own, but I want to make all sorts of cute & cozy games. 
- 📫 How to reach me best would be via Discord or on the Fediverse. On Discord, I am Sunsetbassist, and on Fedi I'm @SunsetFelid and primarily use tech.lgbt or lgbtqia.space.
